This project was just an exercise to get familiar with the Notion api.  

No one should use it for anything.  
If you do want to use it for some reason you will need to follow Notion instructions [for adding an integration](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api) and then give this extension access to the page you want to edit

## Install

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dmweis/notion-rainbowify
```
